When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm looking for feedback from other users, or posting my personal projects as part of my CV.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be certain changes that I feel aren't ready for public viewing yet,
which is why I wouldn't want Git to stay in-sync at all times with my remote repository.
