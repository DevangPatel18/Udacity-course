When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm looking for feedback from other users, or posting my personal projects as part of my CV.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be certain changes that I feel aren't ready for public viewing yet,
which is why I wouldn't want Git to stay in-sync at all times with my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are just clones that exist within GitHub, and can be collaborated upon with other users.
They would be used to clone a GitHub user's repo for my own use while still indicating the original creator.
Clones are simply copies of repos which exist locally on the user's computer.
Branches exist within both forks and clones, and can be used to copy a specific group of commits.
