When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm looking for feedback from other users, or posting my personal projects as part of my CV.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There might be certain changes that I feel aren't ready for public viewing yet,
which is why I wouldn't want Git to stay in-sync at all times with my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are just clones that exist within GitHub, and can be collaborated upon with other users.
They would be used to clone a GitHub user's repo for my own use while still indicating the original creator.
Clones are simply copies of repos which exist locally on the user's computer.
Branches exist within both forks and clones, and can be used to copy a specific group of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can get all the recent changes on the origin/master branch, which would be
very useful in the context of collaboration.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub, one could collaborate using email, usb drives, and 
conversing in-person and exchanging ideas and solutions. This would be far
more tedious and time-consuming though, and the only benefit it brings is 
immediate communication among people in the same room.
